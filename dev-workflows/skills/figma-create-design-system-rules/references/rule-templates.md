# What design system rules are, and the Step-3 rule templates

Supporting reference for the `figma-create-design-system-rules` skill (Step 3).

## What Are Design System Rules?

Design system rules are project-level instructions that encode the "unwritten knowledge" of your codebase - the kind of expertise that experienced developers know and would pass on to new team members:

- Which layout primitives and components to use
- Where component files should be located
- How components should be named and structured
- What should never be hardcoded
- How to handle design tokens and styling
- Project-specific architectural patterns

Once defined, these rules dramatically reduce repetitive prompting and ensure consistent output across all Figma implementation tasks.

## Rule templates

### General Component Rules

```markdown
- IMPORTANT: Always use components from `[YOUR_PATH]` when possible
- Place new UI components in `[COMPONENT_DIRECTORY]`
- Follow `[NAMING_CONVENTION]` for component names
- Components must export as `[EXPORT_PATTERN]`
```

### Styling Rules

```markdown
- Use `[CSS_FRAMEWORK/APPROACH]` for styling
- Design tokens are defined in `[TOKEN_LOCATION]`
- IMPORTANT: Never hardcode colors - always use tokens from `[TOKEN_FILE]`
- Spacing values must use the `[SPACING_SYSTEM]` scale
- Typography follows the scale defined in `[TYPOGRAPHY_LOCATION]`
```

### Figma MCP Integration Rules

```markdown
## Figma MCP Integration Rules

These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

### Required Flow (do not skip)

1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s)
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high-level node map, then re-fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented
4. Only after you have both get_design_context and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles, and framework
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete

### Implementation Rules

- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with `[YOUR_STYLING_APPROACH]` when applicable
- Reuse existing components from `[COMPONENT_PATH]` instead of duplicating functionality
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior
```

### Asset Handling Rules

```markdown
## Asset Handling

- The Figma MCP server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets
- IMPORTANT: If the Figma MCP server returns a localhost source for an image or SVG, use that source directly
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages - all assets should be in the Figma payload
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided
- Store downloaded assets in `[ASSET_DIRECTORY]`
```

### Project-Specific Conventions

```markdown
## Project-Specific Conventions

- [Add any unique architectural patterns]
- [Add any special import requirements]
- [Add any testing requirements]
- [Add any accessibility standards]
- [Add any performance considerations]
```
